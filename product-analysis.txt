The #1 product we are working on is MotionFrame.

Based on the document and our strategy to "kill the room," this is a high-end AI tool that transforms Text into Motion. It’s designed to take a simple prompt, generate a high-quality image using a "Steve Jobs-tier" prompt wrapper, and then apply cinematic motion effects like Ken Burns, Parallax, and custom particle overlays.

The MotionFrame "Hero" Features:
The Brain: A sophisticated Prompt Wrapper that acts as an AI Director, ensuring every user input looks like a professional masterpiece.

The Engine: A Python-powered animation suite using OpenCV and MoviePy to create depth and movement where there was none.

The Vibe: A seamless, "Nvidia-style" UI that handles the heavy lifting of AI generation without ever breaking or freezing.
