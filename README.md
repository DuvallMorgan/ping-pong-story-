# 🕵️ MotionFrame v3.3: OSS Agent Hub [SPY KIDS EDITION]

> "The gadget doesn't make the agent. The agent makes the gadget." — Agent Protocol

**MotionFrame** is a tactical OSS (Office of Strategic Services) gadget bay in a repository. This is the **Spy Kids Edition**, a cinematic strike-team engine that bridges the gap between raw intelligence and field-ready motion art.

## 👟 The Gadget Bay (Top Secret)

### 🧠 THE BRAIN: Dual-Layer Intelligence
Integrated narrative logic that understands cinematic strike-team lore. It's not just a bot; it's your OSS Director.

### ⚡ THE MUSCLE: Danger Room Training
A high-spec physics engine capable of non-linear gravity simulations. Test your ocular focus in the **Danger Room** (Web Interactive) where particles collide with Sentinel Shields at 120fps.

### 🛡️ THE SHIELD: Sentinel Logic v2.0
The ultimate guardrail. 100% semantic matching via logic gates to prevent "Code Hallucinations." If it's not visual truth, the Sentinel kills it.

## 🚀 Mission Deployment

### 1. Initiate Secret Sequence
Deploy the entire OSS stack (Brain + Console + Dashboard) with a single command:
```bash
python3 launch.py
```

### 2. Enter the Console
Access the **OSS Command Center** at `http://localhost:5173`.
- **Clearance Level**: Start as a `GUEST_AGENT` and level up.
- **Google Auth Bridge**: Use the **OSS Sign-In** (Google OAuth2) to escalate your clearance and unlock the full masterpiece potential.
- **Holo-Watch Decryption**: Decrypt the MotionFrame Manifesto using the built-in decryption module.

### 3. Field Commands
Use the `AGENT INPUT` console to talk to the Director. Try tactical commands like:
- `oss status`
- `deploy gadgets`
- `render strike team -> rainforest -> Deploy Render`
