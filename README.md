# 🌐 MotionFrame v3.3: Obsidian Void Masterpiece

> "Most people think design is how it looks. We think design is how it works. This is insanely great." — The Vision

**MotionFrame** is a high-performance cinematic strike-team in a repository. It transforms static text into living, breathing, "Void-spec" motion art using a dual-layer intelligence engine, a live API bridge, and an interactive web dashboard.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 🧠 The Intelligence: Dual-Layer Engine
MotionFrame wraps every prompt in **Nvidia-tier technical descriptors** and **Picasso-level artistic flair**. It injects product lore from the "Room Killer" strategy to ensure every output is a masterpiece.

### 💪 The Muscle: Obsidian Physics
Our physics-based particle system (v3.3) simulates gravity, friction, and fluid dynamics at extreme scales.
- **Obsidian Void**: Deep-space non-linear physics and event horizon implosions.
- **Supernova Emitter**: Explosive radial motion with 3000+ particle throughput.
- **FluidFlow Emitter**: Cinematic liquid streams optimized for 120fps.

### 🛡️ The Shield: Sentinel Logic v2.2
A robust semantic validation layer that makes the application **unbreakable**. It kills hallucinations and logic mismatches before they hit the render buffer.

## 🎬 Mission Control Launch

### 🚀 The Global Launch (Orchestrated)
Start the entire stack (API + Dashboard) with a single command:
```bash
python3 launch.py
```

### 🧠 The Python Brain (Standalone)
Launch the interactive creation engine:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 🎨 The Living Dashboard
Interactive web interface running at `http://localhost:5173`.
- **Sentinel Hub**: Real-time logic gate diagnostics.
- **Agent Console**: Terminal-spec prompt orchestration.
- **Telemetry Bar**: Live engine heartbeat (Particles, Latency, CPU).
