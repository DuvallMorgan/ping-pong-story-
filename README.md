"Most people think design is how it looks. We think design is how it works. This is insanely great." — The Vision

MotionFrame isn't just a Python script. It's a cinematic strike-team in a repo. We’ve stripped away the noise of legacy tools and built a high-performance engine that turns static ideas into living, breathing, "Palmer Luckey-spec" masterpieces.

We don't use "standard" tools. We use the best.

The Intelligence: engine/prompt_engine.py — A dual-layer prompt wrapper that auto-injects Nvidia-tier technical descriptors and Picasso-level artistic flair.

The Muscle: src/lib/animation/ — Custom physics-based particle systems and 3D parallax effects.

The Interface: A Jensen Huang-spec UI that shows you the wireframe of the future while it’s rendering.

Steve Jobs Keynote Wrapper: Automatically wraps your prompts in Apple-industrial design logic.

Palmer Luckey "Anduril" Preset: Tactical, rugged, high-spec infrared aesthetics for when you need to build something that actually matters.

Jensen's Shield: Advanced control handling. No crashes. No boring error screens. Just performance.

Picasso Bleed: A motion system that makes AI pixels move like wet oil paint on a canvas.

This is a collaborative masterpiece.

Pull the vision.

Add the muscle.

Push the boundaries.

"We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why even be here?"
