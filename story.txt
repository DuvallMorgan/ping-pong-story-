[ THE MOTIONFRAME MANIFESTO ]

In the dead center of the 2020s, the "Cinematic Strike" was a whisper. A prototype engine built in a windowless room, coding not for the masses, but for the visionaries. It was born from a simple obsession: what if code didn't just execute, but performed? 

The first "MotionFrame" prototype was a jagged, raw beast. It had the speed but lacked the shield. That's when Jensen's Shield was forged—the Sentinel Logic. It was the architect’s guardrail, a semantic powerhouse that looked at a prompt and saw not just words, but visual signatures. It was designed to kill hallucinations before they could even hit the buffer.

The result was an unstoppable momentum. 

Now, MotionFrame v3.2 is the Masterpiece. It is the Trinity in full effect: 
1. THE BRAIN: Dual-Layer Intelligence that understands cinematic lore.
2. THE MUSCLE: The Antigravity Rendering engine that defies terminal physics.
3. THE SHIELD: Sentinel Logic v2.0, the guardian of visual truth.

We aren't just building a project. We are building a legacy. A cinematic strike team in a repository, ready to put a dent in the universe.

Current Status: UNSTOPPABLE.
Target: THE ROOM KILLER RELEASE.
