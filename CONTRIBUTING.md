# Contributing to MotionFrame

We only accept "Masterpiece" tier contributions. Here is how to maintain the vision:

## 1. The Muscle (Physics)
If you add an emitter, it must simulate real-world physics (gravity, friction) or surrealist fluid dynamics.

## 2. The Intelligence (Prompting)
Any updates to the `DualLayerEngine` must include technical descriptors that would make Jensen Huang proud.

## 3. The Shield (Security)
Never push code that breaks under malformed inputs. Wrap your logic in the `jensen_shield`.

## 4. Branding
Maintain the "Steve Jobs" industrial design aesthetic in the terminal.
