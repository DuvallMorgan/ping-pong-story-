# MotionFrame UX Strategy: The Antigravity Manifesto

## 1. The Aesthetic-Usability Effect
* **Concept:** If it looks like a masterpiece, users believe it works like one.
* **Execution:** Use "Nvidia-green" wireframes and "Picasso-style" transitions to make wait times feel intentional.

## 2. The Doherty Threshold
* **Concept:** Keep the computer-human interaction under 400ms.
* **Execution:** The UI must respond to every click *instantly* with a "Heartbeat" animation, even if the AI backend is still thinking.

## 3. Peak-End Rule
* **Concept:** People judge an experience by its most intense point and its end.
* **Execution:** * **Peak:** The Picasso-style paint bleed during animation.
    * **End:** A clean, cinematic "Fade to Black" on the final video export.
