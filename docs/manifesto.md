# The MotionFrame Manifesto

## Vision: Text as the Ultimate Lever
MotionFrame isn't just a tool; it's a cinematic strike-team in a repo. We believe that a high-end prompt shouldn't just result in an image—it should result in **Motion**. 

## Philosophy: Design is How it Works
As the Visionary (Jensen Huang/Steve Jobs spec) intended: 
- **The Muscle**: Physics isn't a suggestion; it's the engine. Gravity, friction, and fluid dynamics determine how pixels bleed.
- **The Intelligence**: AI is a director, not just a generator. Our Dual-Layer engine ensures every input is wrapped in technical precision and artistic flair.
- **The Shield**: Software should be unbreakable. Jensen's Shield ensures that even under stress, the vision lives on.

## The Goal: Kill the Room
We don't build "standard" tools. We build "Masterpieces." Every render, every terminal frame, every line of telemetry is designed to **WOW**.
